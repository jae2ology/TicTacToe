# C-Sharp Tic Tac Toe Game! Made as a Windows Form App in Rider IDE. 

### This is what the application looks like:

## In the game, you play tic tac toe against a CPU that uses random number generators to choose which button position to play. 
### The game keeps track of how many times you won or the CPU has won.
### Finally, it has a restart game function. If you feel like you're going to lose, you can restart and play again! It does not mess with the current score.
### Closing the application will reset your score!
